                    <p>The ball pit at OCR Pursuit is no ordinary playground feature — it’s a massive, four-and-a-half-foot-deep sea of over 100,000 balls that feels more like an endurance challenge than a casual dip. The moment you jump in, you’re swallowed up by the colourful chaos, struggling to stay afloat as you wade through the endless layers. It’s fun, disorienting, and just a little terrifying — especially when you realize how hard it is to get out. Definitely worth trying once, but keep your phone (and maybe your shoes) far away unless you want to lose them to the depths forever.</p>

                    <p>The Cove Wall at Pursuit OCR is a thrilling challenge that feels straight out of an action movie. With its towering curved ramp and glowing neon cubes floating overhead, it’s designed to test your speed, strength, and determination. You’ll feel the rush as you sprint toward the wall, push off, and try to reach the top a perfect mix of athleticism and adrenaline. The vibrant lights and bold design make it not only an exciting obstacle to conquer but also a spot that practically begs for a victory photo once you’ve made it to the top.</p>

                        <li>Neon lights and cube art make it feel like you’ve stepped into a sci-fi adventure</li>
                        <li>Whether you conquer it on the first try or the fifth, you’ll leave grinning—and maybe a little breathless.</li>
                        <li>Great for grip, balance, and courage (and an epic photo opportunity!)</li>
